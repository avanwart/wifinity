# Notes about my code #
* I have separate HTML markup for Nonmobile and Mobile viewports.  This allows us to create an entirely separate and optimized look and feel for Mobile, specifically.
* I am using jQuery for form validation and basic DOM manipulation.  All jQuery appears just before </body> for each page
* Twitter Bootstrap for Responsive Scaffolding.  The HTML markup will need to be preserved in order for the view layer to remain intact.
